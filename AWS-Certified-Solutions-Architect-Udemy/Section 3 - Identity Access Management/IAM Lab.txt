IAM Lab
    - IAM is universal and does not apply to regions at this time
    - The "root account" is simply the account created when first setup your AWS account
        - It has complete Admin Access
    - New Users have NO permissions when first created
    - New Users are assigned Access Key ID and Secret Access Keys when first created
        - These are not the same as a password
        - You cannot use the Access key ID and secret Access Key to login in to the console
        - You use this to access AWS via the APIs and Command Line
        - You only get to view these once.
            - If you lose them, you have to regenerate them
            - So save them in a secure location
